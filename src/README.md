# src Directory

This directory contains the implementations for all classes and functions defined in the `include` directory. It is organized to mirror the structure of the `include` directory, making it easy to locate the source files corresponding to each header file.

For more information about each class and the organization of the code, refer to the `include` directory documentation. 

There are less `.cpp` files than `.h` files because some classes and functions are implemented as header-only for performance reasons or due to their simplicity. Header-only implementations allow for inlining and can reduce compilation times in certain scenarios.
